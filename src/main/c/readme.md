Forked https://rubygems.org/gems/github-markdown(0.6.8 - December 5, 2014), removed rb files, slightly modified
 to work with jna and cross-compile using cmake.

#Cross-compiling
 Cross-compilation is done with cmake and gcc from http://crossgcc.rts-software.org/doku.php To generate libs use generatelibs.sh.
